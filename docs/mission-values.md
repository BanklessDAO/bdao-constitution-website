# Mission and Values

Mission
We will help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture. The nodes in our growing ecosystem collaborate to create inroads for people to discover, use, learn and enjoy the benefits of Web3. Everyone falls down the rabbit hole in a different wayâ€”we provide those diverse paths. 

Vision
Our Vision is to make financial independence, decentralized work, and creative freedom accessible to all. We work to build a world where anyone with an internet connection has access to the tools needed to achieve financial independence. We want everyone to be able to open a computer, find a DAO, start working, and get paid. We want to enable visionaries to unlock their true creative freedom with the power of Web3. 

Values
Education
We learn from each other. We seek to become a trusted guide that empowers people all over the globe to adopt decentralized finance by sharing accurate, truthful, and objective information.

Integrity
We operate transparently and build trust through radically public discourse and financial auditability.

Decentralized Governance
We put decision-making into the hands of the collective. We create legitimacy through an environment where the best ideas win.

Culture
We reward action and embrace risk. We empower our community to continually drive new initiatives by providing a space to self-organize and quickly move from idea to action.
