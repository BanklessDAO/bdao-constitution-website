# DAO Funding

Funds are released from this treasury in one of three ways: Seasonal budgets, Mid-season grants, and through monthly community-wide Coordinape rounds. 

Seasonal Budgets
New seasons are initiated by all guilds and projects submitting proposals for funding. If these proposals pass Forum approval, they are packaged together in a single seasonal budget approval Snapshot vote. If this budget is approved, then the DAO multi-signers are responsible for issuing disbursements in line with the approved budget.

Mid-Season Grants
Groups seeking funding over the course of a season will be directed to the Grants Committee upon successfully passing their Forum proposal. The Grants Committee is responsible to evaluate these requests and has the liberty to accept or reject these requests for funds. 

Monthly Coordinape
BanklessDAO runs a monthly Coordinape round for Guest Pass holders, L1s, and L2s to reward the community for continued growth and engagement. Community members are required to fill out a coordinape-request-form prior to the start of each round using the bot-commands channel on discord. Those who have successfully filled out the form are eligible to allocate GIVE tokens to their peers using the Coordinape app after the signup period ends and the allocation period starts. Members may decide to opt-out of rounds if they choose to do so.

Intrateam Compensation
BanklessDAO does not dictate how projects or guilds internally allocate their funds as long as the promised value or expected utility is being realized to the community. The free market mechanics of supply and demand along with individuals' personal proficiency and experience determine how goods and services are priced within the community just as they are without.
