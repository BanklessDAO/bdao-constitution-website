# The Bankless Movement

Bankless is a movement for pioneers seeking liberation from the tyranny of the traditional financial system. Going Bankless means adopting decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant technology. Through these means, we will achieve financial self-sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

We seek new ways to build wealth, solve human coordination problems, create culture, and develop cutting-edge thought-leadership in the crypto space. Going Bankless means taking control of your financial health by adopting decentralized and permissionless money systems. 

Bankless is the movement educating the world on how to do it.
