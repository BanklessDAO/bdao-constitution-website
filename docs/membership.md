# Membership

Membership Levels
The collective body of BanklessDAO Discord users is referred to as the BanklessDAO community and is further subdivided into various levels. Membership levels are determined using community-wide roles in Discord. While these roles may grant owners certain access and admin privileges, they do not constitute a hierarchical system granting authority over others. They are social signals designed to aid in communication and coordination. All non-members have two ways to join the DAO. They can either hold 35,000 BANK tokens in their ETH wallet or get a free temporary guest pass by completing our onboarding process. 

Guests
Guests are designated by their “Guest Pass” role tag. Guest pass holders are granted 14 days to investigate, participate, and test the community waters. Individuals who desire to move beyond the guest status do so by confirming that they possess at least 35,000 BANK tokens at a single address.

L1 - Members
Full DAO members are those who have accumulated the requisite 35,000 BANK and are authenticated in the Discord server. The benefits of L1s include access to additional Discord channels and no longer needing to renew the guest pass. 

L2 - Contributors
Level 2 community members possess at least 35,000 BANK and have earned special recognition from their peers as valuable members of the DAO. L2 members are expected to be actively interested and engaged in governance and the overall health of the DAO as a community. Promotion to L2 status occurs through the following process:

Any Level 1 can nominate their peer to join Level 2 in the "polls" Discord channel. You cannot nominate yourself. You must be a Level 1 to qualify for Level 2.
Any Level 2 Contributor must second your nomination to get to the voting stage.
A 48-hour poll will take place to vote on whether to make the member a Contributor. Anyone may vote. See: How to Use the Poll Bot
The poll must include the following information:
