# Preamble

This document represents BanklessDAO’s values, mission, structure, processes, and governance according to the best of our community’s ability to capture it. It is the codification of our community operating system and is meant to serve, rather than constrain its members. 

Not every item listed herein has a readily available citation, as some of these processes were decided within Discord but it's our intention to use this document as the canonical basis or “bible” for discussions regarding governance going forward. Like our community itself, it will always be a work in progress. As the community changes, so should the manifestation of those changes in daily DAO life be captured and reflected in this document. It is our hope that this textually centered approach to governance materially improves our collective ability to precisely communicate, make decisions, and onboard new members.
