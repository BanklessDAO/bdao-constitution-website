  "description": "BanklessDAO was founded by David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams on May 4th, 2021, when they airdropped BANK tokens to each Bankless premium subscriber. Following the true ethos of decentralization, they stepped back and let the DAO take shape. While their media company, Bankless LLC, continues to operate as its own media node, the Bankless brand is propagated through the DAO and its sub-DAOs. Now, the Bankless ecosystem as a whole creates user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.",
